# Lichess-Old-Ultrabullet-Icon
Replaces the new ultrabullet icons with the cursor


- Install Stylus (Chrome Extension). On a mobile phone one could try to install a Kiwi browser (a Chromium browser which allows installing extensions), and then install Stylus there (haven't tested); 
- Go to Lichess, click the Stylus's icon (right top) and click "Create a new style for Lichess.org";
- Copy paste the content of the Ultrabullet.css file into the Stylus's window.
